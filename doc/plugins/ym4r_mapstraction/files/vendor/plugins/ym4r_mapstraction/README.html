      <h1>YM4R/Mapstraction plugin for Rails</h1>
<p>
This is the YM4R/Mapstraction plugin for Rails. It is aimed at facilitating
the use of the Mapstraction library from Rails application.
</p>
<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>
I present here the most common operations you would want to do with
YM4R/Mapstraction. Read the rest of the documents if you want more details.
</p>
<p>
In your controller, here is a typical initialization sequence in action
<tt>index</tt>:
</p>
<pre>
        def index
          @map = Mapstraction.new(&quot;map_div&quot;,:yahoo)
          @map.control_init(:small =&gt; true)
          @map.center_zoom_init([75.5,-42.56],4)
          @map.marker_init(Marker.new([75.6,-42.467],:label =&gt; &quot;Hello&quot;, :info_bubble =&gt; &quot;Info! Info!&quot;,
                :icon =&gt; &quot;/images/icon02.png&quot;))
        end
</pre>
<p>
Here I create a Mapstraction map (which will be placed inside a DIV of id
<tt>map_div</tt>) which will use Yahoo! Maps, add a small control (it is
the only available control currently), set the center and the zoom and add
a marker. The 3 possible options to pass to the <tt>Marker</tt> constructor
are all shown above. Of these 4 steps only the creation of the map and the
setting of the center and the zoom are absolutely necessary. Apart from
Yahoo! Maps, I could have created a map of type <tt>:google</tt> (Google
Maps) or <tt>:microsoft</tt> (Virtual Earth).
</p>
<p>
In your view, here is what you would have:
</p>
<pre>
        &lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;Test&lt;/title&gt;
        &lt;%= Mapstraction.header(:yahoo) %&gt;
        &lt;%= @map.to_html %&gt;
        &lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;
        &lt;%= @map.div(:width =&gt; 600, :height =&gt; 400) %&gt;
        &lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;
</pre>
<p>
First you must output the header, used by all the maps of the page: It
includes the Mapstraction JS code and the JS helper functions of
YM4R/Mapstraction. It also includes the API files, as determined according
to the parameter of the method. Usually, if you only have one map, there
will be a single symbol, identical to the one used to create the map. But
you can also pass an array of symbols, in which case all the corresponding
API&#8216;s will be included. Then we initialize the map by calling
<tt>@map.to_html</tt>. In the body, we need a DIV whose <tt>id</tt> is the
same as the one passed to the Mapstraction constructor in the controller.
The call to <tt>@map.div</tt> outputs such a DIV. We pass to it options to
set the width and height of the map in the style attribute of the DIV.
</p>
<p>
<b>Note that you need to set a size for the map DIV element at some point
or the map will not be displayed.</b> You have a few ways to do this:
</p>
<ul>
<li>You define it yourself, wherever you want. Usually as part of the layout
definition in an external CSS.

</li>
<li>In the head of the document, through a CSS instruction output by
<tt>@map.header_width_height</tt>, to which you pass 2 arguments (width and
height).

</li>
<li>When outputting the DIV with <tt>@map.div</tt>, you can also pass an option
hash, with keys <tt>:width</tt> and <tt>:height</tt> and a style attribute
for the DIV element will be output.

</li>
</ul>
<p>
You can update the map trough RJS. Here is an action you can call from a
<tt>link_remote_tag</tt> which would do this:
</p>
<pre>
        def update
          @map = Variable.new(&quot;map&quot;)
          @marker = Marker.new([75.89,-42.767],:label =&gt; &quot;Update&quot;, :info_bubble =&gt; &quot;I have been placed through RJS&quot;)
        end
</pre>
<p>
Here, I first bind the Ruby <tt>@map</tt> variable to the JS variable
<tt>map</tt>, which already exists in the client browser. <tt>map</tt> is
by default the name given to a map created from YM4R/Mapstraction (this
could be overriden by passing a second argument to the Mapstraction
constructor). Then I create a marker.
</p>
<p>
And you would have inside the RJS template for the action:
</p>
<pre>
        page &lt;&lt; @map.remove_all_markers
        page &lt;&lt; @map.add_marker(@marker)
</pre>
<p>
Here I first clear the map of all markers. Then I add the marker. Note that
the <tt>marker_init</tt> is not used anymore since, as its name indicates,
this method is only for the initialization of the map.
</p>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>
Install like any other Rails plugin:
</p>
<pre>
        ruby script/plugin install svn://rubyforge.org/var/svn/ym4r/Plugins/Mapstraction/trunk/ym4r_mapstraction
</pre>
<p>
As part of the installation procedure, the JavaScript files found in the
<tt>PLUGIN_ROOT/javascript</tt> directory will be copied to the
<tt>RAILS_ROOT/public/javascripts/</tt> directory.
</p>
<p>
Moreover a <tt>gmaps_api_key.yml</tt> file will also be created in the
<tt>RAILS_ROOT/config/</tt> folder. This is in order to setup the Google
Maps API in case you want to use it with Mapstraction. You don&#8216;t need
to do anything special if you use only Yahoo! Maps or Virtual Earth. If
this file already exists (installed for example by a previous version of
the plugin), nothing will be done to it, so you can keep your configuration
data even after updating the plugin. This file is a YAML representation of
a hash, similar to the <tt>database.yml</tt> file in that the primary keys
in the file are the different environments (development, test, production),
since you will probably need to have different Google Maps API keys
depending on that criteria (for example: a key for localhost for
development and test; a key for your host for production). If you
don&#8216;t have any special need, there will be only one key associated
with each environment. If however, you need to have multiple keys (for
example if your app will be accessible from multiple URLs, for which you
need different keys), you can also associate a hash to the environment,
whose keys will be the different hosts. In this case, you will need to pass
a value to the <tt>:host</tt> key when calling the method
<tt>Mapstraction.header</tt> (usually <tt>@request.host</tt>).
</p>
<h2>Operations</h2>
<h3>Static switching between mapping API&#8216;s</h3>
<p>
It is the goal of the Mapstraction API to make it trivial to switch API
(for example, in case the currently used API changes its term of service).
It is equally easy to do this with YM4R/Mapstraction. You need to do 2
things:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Change the provider when creating a Mapstraction map

</li>
<li>Change the provider when calling the <tt>Mapstraction.header</tt>

</li>
</ul>
<h3>Dynamic switching between mapping API&#8216;s</h3>
<p>
The Mapstraction API provides a method <tt>swap</tt> to be called on a
Mapstraction JS object, with the name of the new API as argument, that will
switch the mapping API on the fly. The zoom levels and elements will be
copied over to the new API.
</p>
<h3>Markers</h3>
<p>
Markers are constructed with either a LatLonPoint or a 2D-array of
coordinates in the first argument, followed by an option hash. The keys to
the hash can be <tt>:info_bubble</tt> (text to display when the marker is
clicked), <tt>:label</tt> (summary text of the marker; The way it is
displayed depends on the mapping service used) or <tt>:icon</tt> (to
indicate the URL of an icon to use for the marker). Support for icons is a
bit flaky since the different services have different conventions for their
origins, so you should probably have different sets of icons depending on
the service to make it less confusing for the user.
</p>
<h3>MarkerGroup</h3>
<p>
Surprisingly, MarkerGroups are groups of markers. They can be useful if you
want to be able to show and hide a group of markers at the same time in
response to a user-generated event (for example, as a response to a click
on a link in the HTML page) without having to declare all the markers as
global variables. Instead you declare only the group as global and give it
the markers. Then you can call <tt>show</tt> and <tt>hide</tt> on the
group, to act on all the markers of the group at the same time.
</p>
<h3>Polylines</h3>
<p>
Polylines are constructed with an array of LatLonPoints, as well as with
options like the opacity (<tt>:opacity</tt>), the width (<tt>:width</tt>)
or the color (<tt>:color</tt> and with a value in the form
&quot;RRGGBB&quot;, with RR, GG and BB numbers between 0 and 255 in
hexadecimal form). You add the marker to the map at initialization time
with the method <tt>polyline_init</tt>:
</p>
<pre>
        @map.polyline_init(Polyline.new([LatLonPoint.new([45.12,22.3]),
        LatLonPoint.new([34.12,56.1])],:width =&gt; 5, :color =&gt; &quot;#FF00AB&quot;,
        :opacity =&gt; 0.7))
</pre>
<h3>Clusterer</h3>
<p>
A clusterer contains a large number of markers, which are dynamically
grouped in clusters if needed. This allows to have a lot of markers on a
map without being slowed down too much. It is an adaptation to Mapstraction
of Jef Poskanzer&#8216;s Clusterer2 library for Google Maps. It works for
all 3 Mapstraction backends. To use it from your Rails code, do the
following:
</p>
<pre>
        marker_array = [.....] #large number of markers
        clusterer = Clusterer.new(marker_array,:max_visible_markers =&gt; 20)
        @map.clusterer_init(clusterer)
</pre>
<p>
By default the markers start being clustered when there are more than 150
in the clusterer. Nothing special happens before this. This setting can be
changed with the <tt>:max_visible_markers</tt> option. Other options are
possible. Look inside the JS code inside the <tt>clusterer.js</tt> to know
what they are.
