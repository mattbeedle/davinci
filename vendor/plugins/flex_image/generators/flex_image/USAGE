Description:
    The flex_image generator creates stubs for a new FlexImage model.

    The generator takes a model name as its argument.  The model name may be
    given in CamelCase or under_score and should not be suffixed with 'Model'.

    The generator creates a model class in app/models, a test suite in
    test/unit, test fixtures in test/fixtures/singular_name.yml, and a migration
    in db/migrate.

Example:
    ./script/generate flex_image ProductImage

    This will create a ProductImage model:
        Model:      app/models/product_image.rb
        Test:       test/unit/product_image_test.rb
        Fixtures:   test/fixtures/product_images.yml
        Migration:  db/migrate/XXX_add_product_images.rb
